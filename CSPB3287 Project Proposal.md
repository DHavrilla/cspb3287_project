CSPB3287 Project Proposal

David Havrilla

My goal is to build a web application. A rough sketch using the drawing app in JupyterLab 
provides a rough draft for what I envision as the concept. Given that it's a bloodbank 
database, I want it to be available as a public database for healthcare facilities and 
providers. It should be easily accessible and easy to navigate. Nothing too complicated or 
fancy.

I also plan to use the Google cloud database for storing and accessing data. The SQL 
interface I plan to use is SQLAlchemy. Much of my work will be completed utilzing JupyterLab.
